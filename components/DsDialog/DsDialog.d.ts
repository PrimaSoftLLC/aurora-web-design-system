/**
 * v2 dialog.
 *
 * Three deliberate breaks from v1's `Dialog`:
 * 1. **actions are right-aligned.** v1 centred them with the cancelling action on the
 *    left and the confirming action on the right; centred footers read as a 2015
 *    Material alert and give the primary action no fixed home. v2 right-aligns,
 *    cancel then confirm.
 * 2. **height is content-driven**, capped at `min(90vh,760px)`, instead of a fixed
 *    `65vh` — a two-field dialog no longer opens as a tall empty box.
 * 3. `tone` draws a status glyph in the header, so a destructive confirmation is
 *    recognisable before the copy is read.
 *
 * Confirmation copy keeps the product's voice: quote the object in typographic
 * quotes, state the consequence as a fact — `The driver "X" will be removed from
 * the object "Y"` — and never ask for bravery.
 *
 * `actions` also accepts a child carrying `slot="actions"`; unslotted children are
 * the dialog body.
