/**
 * One collapsible level of the object tree. The panel nests it: user (level 0,
 * avatar) → group or label (level 1, `sell` icon) → DsObjectRow leaves.
 *
 * Why a separate component from DsObjectRow: the header carries aggregate state —
 * how many of its children are selected (`selected / total`), a tri-state
 * select-all, and an aggregated unread count — and it must stay visually lighter
 * than its leaves so the eye reads the tree structure before the rows. Group
 * headers are `--ds-fg-muted`; only user headers are full ink.
 *
 * `level` sets the 20px indent step. Groups with nothing to select pass
 * `selectDisabled` rather than hiding the box, so trailing controls stay in one
 * column down the whole panel.
