/**
 * The monitoring object-panel row, in the shape the panel actually needs:
 * photo disc (with online dot and unread count), a two-glyph status column
 * (movement, rotated to the course + satellite signal), two-line identity, and a
 * trailing selection box.
 *
 * Use `DsListRow` for generic lists (a report picker, a driver list, a geofence
 * list) — it is the neutral row. Use `DsObjectRow` inside the object tree, where
 * an operator scans hundreds of rows for state and only then for name.
 *
 * Rules carried over from the v1 panel review:
 * - the disc colour is data freshness (green / amber / red / grey) — that is the
 *   fastest signal in the panel, so it owns the largest coloured area in the row
 *   and keeps working when a photo is set (the photo sits inside a 2px ring of it);
 * - state lives in the glyph column, never in the row background (the background
 *   is selection/hover only);
 * - unread counts are the only accent-coloured thing in the row;
 * - the details line is prose, not mono — it holds speed, driver and last message
 *   already formatted by the caller.
