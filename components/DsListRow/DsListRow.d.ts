/**
 * v2 object row — replaces `UnitListRow`.
 *
 * v1's row was a fixed 56px with secondary icons parked at `opacity: 0.5` and
 * snapped to 1 on hover (`.opacity50` → `.clear-opacity`). v2 keeps the reveal for
 * *actions* only — state and values are always at full contrast — and takes its
 * height from `--ds-row-h-lg`, so a compact object panel is 44px instead of 56px
 * and shows three more objects per screen.
 *
 * The subtitle is set in the mono face because it is almost always a plate plus a
 * timestamp, which must not jitter as the clock ticks.
 *
 * `actions` and `badge` also accept children carrying `slot="actions"` / `slot="badge"`.
