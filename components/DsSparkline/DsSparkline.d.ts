 * tooltip, no legend. Anything that needs a value belongs in a `DsChart`. Drawn at
 * 1.5px so it does not out-weigh the text in its own cell, and a gap in the data
 * stays a gap.
 *
 * Do not put one in a `DsObjectRow`'s primary line — the row already carries state,
 * freshness and selection; a fourth signal there is noise.
