# Contributing

Start with the relevant [design rules](docs/design.md) and component card.
Consumer setup belongs in [the usage guide](docs/usage.md); this file describes
changes to the design system itself.

## Development

Use Node 22 through mise. Run commands from the repository root:

```bash
mise exec -- npm ci
mise exec -- npm run dev
```

The catalogue runs at http://127.0.0.1:5173 and rebuilds when sources change.

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tokens/source.json` | Token values, roles and scopes; follow the [naming rules](docs/tokens.md) |
| `styles/` | Shared styles |
| `components/src/` | Component implementations |
| `components/<Name>/` | Declarations, README and preview with `@dsCard` metadata |
| `docs/` | Usage, design, token naming, migration and release guides |

The catalogue discovers previews automatically and derives API props from public
sources and declarations. A prop change updates the implementation, `.d.ts` and
`@dsCard` together. Preserve public names, paths, CSS variables and behaviour.

## Checks

`npm test` builds the project and runs lint, UI, package and release-guard checks.
`npm run verify` also checks the catalogue, documentation links, browser CSS cascade
and installed tarball consumers. Before the first full run, prepare Chromium and
consumer caches (this preparation uses the network):

```bash
mise exec -- npx playwright install chromium
mise exec -- npm ci --prefix tests/consumers/angular-base
mise exec -- npm ci --prefix tests/consumers/angular-charts
mise exec -- npm ci --prefix tests/consumers/angular-legacy
mise exec -- npm run verify
```

For Angular alone: `mise exec -- npm run build`, then
`mise exec -- npm run check:angular` to check the built tarball.
`npm run check:names` checks token names, ladders, status slots and uniqueness.

For every affected example, apply the [screen acceptance criteria](docs/usage.md#приёмка-экрана):
four theme/appearance/density combinations, AXE, keyboard focus and loading states.
Use the [copy rules](docs/design.md#язык-и-тексты) as well.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `develop`; keep one concern per PR. Commit messages are in English.
- Add a consumer-facing line under `## [Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- Label the PR `major` / `minor` / `patch` using the [version policy](docs/release.md#versioning).
- Colour only through tokens, dimensions in px, external spacing owned by the parent.

## Generated files

`npm run build` creates `dist/`, `site/`, compatible token CSS/JSON, scoped CSS
and component bundles. Edit their source files, never generated copies.

## Releasing

Follow [versions and publishing](docs/release.md). Agent restrictions are in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Documentation

README is the entry point; each guide owns one subject. Link to an existing rule
instead of repeating it. Component READMEs hold usage and design decisions;
generated API pages show checked props. Keep guide links and package documentation
in sync when moving files.

Completed plans live in `docs/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/`; migration notes are
in `assets/notes/`. The historical presentation is in `templates/leadership-deck/`.
These record past decisions; current instructions are the guides linked above.
